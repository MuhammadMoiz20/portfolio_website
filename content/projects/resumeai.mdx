ResumeAI helps students iterate on resumes quickly with clear, actionable suggestions and a UI that works for everyone.

## Backstory

I mentored peers on resume reviews and saw the same friction points: formatting, phrasing, and tailoring to roles. I wanted a tool that guides people through improvements with guardrails—not a black box.

## Frontend (React)

- Component library with consistent spacing, typography, and focus states; keyboard‑navigable modals and menus.
- Form primitives with inline validation and helpful defaults; autosave to avoid losing work.
- High‑contrast themes and ARIA labeling aligned to common accessibility guidance.

## Backend (Flask)

- Clean endpoints for analysis and suggestions with input validation.
- Separation between parsing, heuristics, and scoring to keep logic testable.
- Unit tests for core analyzers and request/response contracts.

## Features

- Structured feedback on action verbs, metrics, and clarity.
- Export to common formats with consistent margins and typography.
- Privacy‑aware by design: the app processes text for suggestions and avoids retaining content beyond the session.

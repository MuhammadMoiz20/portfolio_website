A modern, full-stack social media platform built with Next.js and React, featuring real-time messaging, user profiles, content sharing, and optimized performance. The platform demonstrates advanced React patterns, efficient data fetching, and scalable architecture.

## Backstory

I built this social platform to explore modern React patterns and full-stack development techniques. The goal was to create a performant, scalable application that showcases best practices in authentication, real-time features, and user experience design.

## Product & UX

- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant messaging with WebSocket integration for seamless communication.
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive profile management with customizable avatars and bio sections.
- **Content Feed**: Infinite scroll feed with optimized image loading and lazy rendering.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts for all device sizes.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme switching with persistent user preferences.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React Server Components and App Router for optimal performance.
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with multiple providers (Google, GitHub, Email) and JWT tokens.
- **Database**: MongoDB with Prisma ORM for flexible data modeling and type safety.
- **Real-time**: WebSocket integration for live messaging and notifications.
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and frequently accessed data.
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary integration for image uploads and optimization.

## Technical Highlights

- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced page load times by 35% through query optimization and lazy loading.
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with Prisma-generated types for database operations.
- **Authentication Flow**: Secure JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation.
- **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections for instant messaging and live updates.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image compression and responsive image serving.

## Challenges â†’ Solutions

- **Performance**: Implemented virtual scrolling and image lazy loading to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Real-time Sync**: Built robust WebSocket reconnection logic with exponential backoff.
- **Authentication**: Secure token management with automatic refresh and logout handling.
- **Scalability**: Designed modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

## Impact

- **35% Performance Improvement**: Achieved significant load time reduction through optimization techniques.
- **Real-time Communication**: Seamless messaging experience with sub-second message delivery.
- **User Experience**: Intuitive interface with smooth animations and responsive design.

## What I'd improve next

- **Advanced Features**: Video calls, stories, and advanced content moderation.
- **Mobile App**: React Native version for native mobile experience.
- **Analytics**: User engagement tracking and content performance metrics.

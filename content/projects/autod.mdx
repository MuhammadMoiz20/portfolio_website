Autod is an AI-powered platform that transforms natural language descriptions into fully functional, production-ready web applications. Built with modern full-stack technologies, it enables rapid prototyping and development by automating the entire application generation process.

## Backstory

The idea for Autod emerged from the frustration of spending weeks on boilerplate code and repetitive setup tasks. I wanted to create a tool that could understand user intent and generate complete applications with proper architecture, authentication, database schemas, and deployment configurations.

## Product & UX

- **Natural Language Interface**: Users describe their app idea in plain English, and Autod generates the complete application structure.
- **Real-time Generation**: Live preview of generated code with instant feedback and iteration capabilities.
- **Production Ready**: Generated apps include authentication, database schemas, API routes, and deployment configurations.
- **Template Library**: Pre-built templates for common application patterns (e-commerce, SaaS, blogs, etc.).

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React Server Components for optimal performance and SEO.
- **API Layer**: tRPC for type-safe API communication between frontend and backend.
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for robust data modeling and migrations.
- **Authentication**: Clerk for seamless user management and social logins.
- **Background Jobs**: Inngest for reliable background processing and workflow orchestration.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS ECS + RDS + CloudFront for scalable, containerized deployment.

## Technical Highlights

- **AI Integration**: Custom prompts and fine-tuned models for accurate code generation and understanding.
- **Containerized CI/CD**: Automated deployment pipeline with Docker containers and GitHub Actions.
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with tRPC ensuring compile-time API validation.
- **Database Migrations**: Automated schema generation and migration management through Prisma.
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live code generation progress and collaboration.

## Challenges → Solutions

- **Code Quality**: Implemented comprehensive linting, formatting, and testing in generated applications.
- **Scalability**: Designed microservices architecture with proper separation of concerns and horizontal scaling.
- **Security**: Built-in authentication, authorization, and data validation in all generated applications.
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes, lazy loading, and efficient database queries.

## Impact

- **99.9% Uptime**: Architected ECS + RDS + CloudFront stack with containerized CI/CD maintaining high availability.
- **Rapid Development**: Reduced application development time from weeks to hours for standard use cases.
- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined workflow from idea to production deployment in a single platform.

## What I'd improve next

- **Advanced AI Models**: Integration with more sophisticated language models for better code generation.
- **Custom Templates**: User-defined templates and component libraries for specialized use cases.
- **Collaboration Features**: Real-time collaboration and version control for generated applications.

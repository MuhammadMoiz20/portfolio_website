I implemented a miniature search engine in C with three components—Crawler, Indexer, Querier—focused on correctness, memory safety, and performance.

## Backstory

This project was a deep dive into IR fundamentals: fetching pages, building an index, and answering free‑text queries efficiently without the crutch of high‑level libraries.

## Architecture

- Crawler: respectful fetcher with URL normalization, deduplication, and domain scoping.
- Indexer: inverted index over tokens with document frequencies; compact in‑memory representation plus on‑disk persistence.
- Querier: tokenizes and normalizes queries, ranks results using index statistics, and prints annotated matches.

## Engineering Practices

- Defensive programming throughout; all allocations checked, and errors surfaced with clear codes.
- Valgrind‑driven iteration to eliminate leaks and undefined behavior.
- Tight inner loops and careful data layout to reduce cache misses on lookups.

## Performance

- Index optimizations and early‑exit strategies reduced average query latency from 25s to ~1s on the reference corpus.
- Bounded memory and streaming writes during indexing to handle larger inputs gracefully.

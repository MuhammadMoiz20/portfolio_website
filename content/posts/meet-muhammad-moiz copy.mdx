Every journey in tech starts with curiosity. For me, it began with the thrill of breaking down how systems work and the challenge of building something better. That spark grew into a path that now weaves through software engineering, research, and real-world projects—each step pushing me to ask bigger questions and tackle harder problems.

At Dartmouth College, I’ve immersed myself in Computer Science and Engineering, exploring everything from the low-level mechanics of compilers and operating systems to the cutting-edge possibilities of AI and distributed systems. But learning doesn’t stop at theory—I’ve brought these skills into action: scaling e-commerce platforms, optimizing archival workflows for universities, and experimenting with projects that blur the line between utility and creativity.

Innovation, for me, isn’t just about writing efficient code. It’s about crafting solutions that matter—whether that’s helping a campus community connect more easily, making digital history more accessible, or finding ways to turn ideas into scalable products.

This blog is where I’ll share that journey: the lessons learned, the experiments that worked (and the ones that didn’t), and the vision that keeps me moving forward. If you’re curious about tech, driven by innovation, or simply interested in where ambition meets engineering, I invite you to follow along.

Vibe coding is the practice of using AI tools to generate or modify code with minimal manual typing and, often, minimal line-by-line reading. It sits on a spectrum: at one end, developers use autocomplete to speed up routine work, while at the other, they issue natural-language prompts to an “agentic” tool that scans the repository, proposes diffs, and implements changes. Crucially, “vibing” does not mean ignoring engineering judgement. It’s a way to offload boilerplate, scaffolding, and low-stakes code so humans can concentrate on design, architecture, and the parts of the system that truly matter.

## Who can use vibe coding

Anyone who writes software can benefit, but outcomes differ by skill level. Experienced engineers gain the most: they already understand the problem space, can specify intent clearly, and know when to accept or reject AI-generated diffs. Intermediate developers can use it to accelerate learning and delivery. They still read critical code paths and ask “why,” not just “what.” Absolute beginners may produce demos, scripts, and personal tools, but if they rely on vibe coding to avoid fundamentals, they will stall as soon as things break. In short, the more you know, the safer and more effective you can vibe.

## Will vibe coding replace engineers?

It will not. Just as tractors didn’t make everyone a farmer, better coding tools won’t make everyone an engineer. They raise the leverage of skilled people, allowing fewer engineers to deliver more value. Software still demands problem framing, systems thinking, risk trade-offs, security awareness, performance tuning, cross-team coordination, and taste. Tools draft; engineers decide. If a tool consistently outperforms you on core tasks, the answer is not “let the tool run”—then automate.

## When it _can_ replace engineers

Vibe coding can “replace engineering” in narrow, well-bounded cases, effectively removing the need for dedicated human effort on:

- **Throwaway and prototype code:** rapid UI stubs, spikes, and experiments to validate direction before committing real time.
- **Boilerplate and glue:** repetitive wiring, configuration, and scaffolding that follows clear patterns.
- **Tiny utilities and internal tools:** one-off scripts, format converters, batch data fixers, and productivity helpers that would never justify a sprint.
- **Micro-dependencies:** functions so small you might once have installed a package; now you can generate, keep in-house, and move on.

In these contexts, the “engineering” needed is modest, the risk is low, and replacement frees humans to focus on the genuinely hard bits.

## Where it can’t replace engineers

Vibe coding cannot replace engineers where judgment, deep understanding, or long-term ownership are essential:

- **Core domain logic and architecture:** modelling the business, shaping boundaries, and designing for evolution.
- **Safety- or security-critical systems:** anything with strict reliability, compliance, or adversarial threats.
- **Performance-sensitive paths:** algorithmic choices, memory/CPU trade-offs, and careful optimisation.
- **Complex paradigms and frameworks you don’t yet understand:** e.g., advanced concurrency or unfamiliar libraries—using AI here without comprehension breeds fragile code.
- **Sustained maintenance:** roadmaps, refactors, incident response, and the human coordination required to keep systems healthy.

## Conclusion

Vibe coding is best seen as a pragmatic accelerator, not a profession-killer. Use it to clear the underbrush: prototypes, scaffolding, utilities, and micro-solutions that unlock momentum. Pair it with human review where the stakes are real, and treat it as a force multiplier once you already understand the problem. The discipline is simple: decide what is core, what is commodity, and what is trash. Read and craft the core, generate the commodity with oversight, and vibe the trash you’re happy to throw away. Done this way, vibe coding doesn’t replace engineers; it enables them to do their best work more often.
